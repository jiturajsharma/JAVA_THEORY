** Operator and Expressions
-> Operator and used to perform operations on variable and values.

-----TYPES OF OPERATORS------
-> Arithemetic Operators -> +, -, * / , %, ++, --
-> Assignment Operators -> =, +, =
 -> Comparision operators -> ==, >=, <=
 -> Bitwise Operators -> &, |, coperates Bitwise

 * Arithemetic operators cannot work with booleans % operator can work on floats & doubles

 ** Precedence of operators :->
                        The operators are applied and evaluated based on precdence. for example (+, -) has less precedence compared to (*, I). Hence 4& / are evaluated first
                        In case we like to change this order, we use parenthesis
    **Associativity:->
                    Associativity tells the direction of execution of operators. In can either be left to right or right to left.
                    * / -> L to right
                    + - -> L to right
                    ++ = -> R to left

* Resulting data type ofter arithemetic operations
    -> Following table summariges the resulting data type after artithemetic oprator on them.

    **j Increment and Decrement operators
    -> a++ , ++a -> Increment operators - Datatype
    -> a--, --a -> Decrement operator - remain same

                There will operate on all data types except booleans
                a++ -> First use the value and then increment 
                ++a -> First increment the value the use increment
