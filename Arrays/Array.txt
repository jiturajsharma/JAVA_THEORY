** Array is a collection of  similar types of data

Use Case:- 
                Storing makes of 5 students
    int[] makes = new int [5] -> (data types ArrayName)

    ** Accessing Array Elements :-
                        Array elements can be caused as follows 
                    marks[0] = 100;
                    marks[2]= 43,53;        -> Note that index starts from 0
                    marks [4] = 34;

    So in a nut shell, this is how is array words:
    1. int[] marks;         -> Declation!
    2. marks = new int[5];  -> Memory allocation

    int [] marks = new int[5] -> Declaring + memory allocation!
    int [] marks = {200, 43, 53,343} -> Declared + initialize!

    -> Array index starts from 0 and goes till (n-1) where n is the size of array.

    * Array Length  :-
                    Array have a length property which gives the length of the Array.;
                            marks.length -> gives 5 if marks makes is a replace to array with 5 ele4ments


* Displaying an Array :->
                    An array can be displayed using a for loop;
        for(int i=0; i<marks.length;i++){
            sout(marks[i]) -> array traversal
        }

    
    * For-each-lop in java:-
                Array elements can also be traversed as follows:-

            for(int element : Arr){
                sout (element); -> Prints all the elments
            }

        
    ** Multidimensional Arrays:-
                    Multidimensional arrays are array of arrays each elements of a M-D array is an array itself marks in the previous example ways a -D  


    Multidimensional 2-D Array :-
                A 2-D array can be created as follows:-
            int [] [] floats = new int [2] [3]
