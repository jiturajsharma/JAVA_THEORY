* You might want to buy an umbrealla if its raining and you have the money.
* Your order the need if also or your favorite behind is listed on the menu.

** All the are decisions which depends on a certain condition being meet.
        In java, we can execute instructions on a condition being met.


        ** Decision making Instructions in java.
        -> If-else Statement.
        -> Switch Statement.


        *If-Else  Statement:-
                        The syntax of an If-else Statement in C looks like that of C++ and JavaScrit java has a simillar syntax  too. It looks like:

                        if(condition to be checked){
                            Statement-if-condition-true;
                        }

                        else {
                            Statement - if -condition-false
                        }

                        ** Code Example :-
                            int a = 543;
                            if(a>545){
                                System.out.println("You can drive);
                            }

                            -> Note that the else block is optional

                            ** Relational operators in Java:-
                                        Relational operators are used to evaluate condition (true or false) inside the if Statement; some example of relational operators are:
        ==, >=, <, >, <=, !=

        -> Note :- '=' is used for assignemt where as '==' is used for equality check.
        The coindition can be either ture or false;



        * Logical operators:-
                &&, ||, and ! are most commonly used logically operators in java.
                These are read as:-
                    && -> AND
                    || -> OR
                    ! -> NOT


    ** AND operator :-
                Evaluate to true if both the condition are true.
    ** OR operator :-
                Evalu8ates to true when at leaset one of the        conditions is true.

    ** NOT operator:- 
                Negates the given logica (true because false and false becomes true)
                !Y = N                  Y-true
                !N = Y                   N - false

** else if clause :-
                Instead of using multiple if Statement, we can also use else if along with if thus forming an if -else if-else ladder.  
                        Using such kind of logical reduces indents. last else is executed only if all the conditons fail.

        if(condition){
            // Statement
        }
        else if{
            //Statement
        }
        else {
            // Statement
        }


        ** Switch Case control instructions:-
                        Switch case is used when we have to make a choice between number of alternatives for a given variable.
                        Switch (var) {
                            //code;
                            break;
                        }
                        case c2:
                                //code
                                break;
                        case c3;
                            // code
                            break;
                        defaut;
                        //code
            

-> Var can  be an integer, character or string in java.
-> A Switch can occuer within another but in practice this is rarely done.
